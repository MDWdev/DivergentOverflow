# DivergentOverflow
Real-world, neurodivergent-friendly coding examples for every kind of mind.

**DivergentOverflow** is a developer knowledge base built for neurodivergent thinkers — and for anyone who's ever read a tutorial and thought:

> “Okay but... why are we sorting integers again?”

Instead of relying only on abstract, number-heavy examples, this project explains every algorithm and coding concept using **both**:
- 🧮 Traditional examples (arrays, ints, loops)
- 🧠 Real-world, emotionally meaningful models (like `User`, `Post`, `Task`, `Folder`, etc.)

Our goal is to make code *click* for those who process logic best through **context, connection, and clarity** — especially for autistic, ADHD, and otherwise beautifully wired minds.

## 💡 Why This Exists

Traditional code examples are optimized for simplicity, not comprehension.  
But neurodivergent brains often need:
- Real-world grounding to reduce abstraction overload
- Pattern recognition in familiar story-like structures
- Language that prioritizes emotional safety and accessibility

DivergentOverflow is here to bridge that gap — so you don’t have to translate “sort this array of numbers” into “sort these files by date” *in your head* every time.

## 🧱 Project Structure

📁 examples/ ├─ binary-search.md ├─ hash-map.md ├─ linked-list.md └─ recursion.md

Each file includes: ✅ Traditional example (with ints) ✅ Real-world version (e.g. users, messages, tasks) ✅ Explanations in plain language


Coming soon:
- 🔎 Tag filtering by concept, task, or cognitive style
- 🌐 Community Q&A threads
- 🧠 Glossary of patterns and metaphors

## 👋 Who This Is For

- Neurodivergent developers (autistic, ADHD, dyslexic, anxious, etc.)
- Bootcamp grads overwhelmed by LeetCode-style examples
- Instructors looking for more inclusive teaching models
- Anyone who's ever felt like coding examples assume you're a robot

---

## 🤝 Contributing

We'd love to have you contribute your brain’s way of seeing things.

🧶 You can:
- Add new example files
- Translate integer examples into real-world ones
- Write “like I’m overstimulated” breakdowns
- Suggest better metaphors or domain models

### To contribute:
1. Fork this repo
2. Add your example or edit an existing one
3. Submit a pull request ✨

(We’ll have templates and guides soon!)

## 📣 Join the Movement

This is just the beginning — and we know how powerful it is to feel like something was *built for your brain.*

If this project speaks to you, please star the repo ⭐️, share it, or open an issue to say hi. You’re not alone in how you think — and the way your brain works *matters here.*

## 🧠 Idea by Melissa Webster

Birthed from the realization that we deserve coding tools that don’t leave us behind — or bored — or exhausted from translating every example.

**DivergentOverflow**: Because we don’t need to fix how we think.  
We just need examples that speak our language.
